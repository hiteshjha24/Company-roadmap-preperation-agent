> ⚙️ **Project Type:** GENAI Task - Research Agent  
> 🧠 **Purpose:** Generate a *targeted interview preparation roadmap* using AI, tailored to the company and role.

---

## 🧩 Overview

This project leverages **Gemini API** and **LangChain** to convert a **Job Description (JD)** into a clear, structured **interview roadmap**.  
It fuses *company-specific data* with *public knowledge* to produce **JSON-based output** ready for integration or further processing.

---

## 🚨 Problem Statement

Preparing for a tech interview = chaos.  
Candidates struggle with:
- Extracting the right keywords from JDs manually.  
- Researching each company’s unique interview process.  
- Combining that info into a structured study plan.  

💡 **This AI Agent automates all of it** — from parsing the JD to researching interview rounds, difficulty, and generating a ready-to-use roadmap.

## 🧠 Tech Stack

| Component | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Language** | Python 🐍 |
| **LLM** | Gemini API (`gemini-2.5-flash-preview-09-2025`) |
| **Framework** | LangChain Expression Language (LCEL) |
| **Structured Output** | Pydantic (JSON Schema Validation) |
| **Env Management** | python-dotenv |

---

## 🏗️ Architecture & Flow

### 1️⃣ Input
The agent requires three inputs:
- `Company Name`
- `Job Role`
- `Job Description (JD)` text

---

### 2️⃣ Job Description Parsing
Performs in-depth analysis to extract and map required skills:

- **Skill Extraction:** Detects key skills like `Python`, `Microservices`, `Data Structures`.
- **Keyword Mapping:** Converts skills into broader domains (e.g., *REST APIs → Backend Development*).

---

### 3️⃣ Company & Difficulty Analysis
Uses **Google Search Tool** to find:
[{Company} {Role} interview process and difficulty]

From there, it infers:
- Interview round types (e.g., Coding, System Design, Behavioral)
- Estimated difficulty level (`Easy`, `Medium`, `Hard`)

---

### 4️⃣ Roadmap Synthesis
The agent merges internal and external findings to produce a **structured JSON** that includes:

| Field | Description |
|-------|--------------|
| `rounds` | Derived from JD & Google Search |
| `topics` | Categorized skills per round |
| `difficulty` | Based on company and role complexity |
| `recommended_order` | Logical learning path |

---
